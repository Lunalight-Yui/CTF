So here is the template

<img width="1919" height="916" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 095640" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb8ea134-4e39-4934-ae58-c498ecf4c838" />

There are 2 text and 1 picture, `what?` and `stay safe`. Lets take a look `what` first:

<img width="1917" height="972" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 095714" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc4e9cbd-b480-4d0a-b4f2-2621564b736c" />

Just explanation of news. How about the other one?

<img width="1919" height="969" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 095707" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09d51e94-d0d8-4ae7-b56e-33662b74bd21" />

Just text. In my mind, i thought it could be `SSTI (server side template injection` since only showing some template like picture and texts. But i notice one thing.

<img width="233" height="59" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 100208" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3094c36d-5c2d-4e36-aa5c-17e77bec4b47" />

I notice some `base64` in there and i try to decode. The result (you can use cyberchef to decode. But me using `burp` since it can decode too and very flexible to solve)

And then my idea came up with 3 possibility. That are `SSPP (server side parameter pollution`, `path traversal (directory traversal)`, and `LFI (local file inclusion)`. Then i denial about SSPP since there is just changing base64 encode. So i eliminate it.
There are 2 left, path traversal and LFI (local file inclusion). What's that?

Path Traversal (directory traversal) is a vulnerability that hacker can access and view the web server file system but outside of the web applicationâ€™s document root folder. What is that mean. Here the example:

<img width="800" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03dac905-45cf-4163-9e5e-bd4435c94c10" />

Local File Inclusion is **ALMOST** same as Path traversal (directory traversal). But this vulnerability attacking inside web server file system within the document root folder. Here's the example:

<img width="600" height="667" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d12b17e-bbda-4f05-a9c8-702190a664f3" />

The difference between LFI and Path traversal is target attack and the function vulnerability. LFI attacking web server file _within_ the document root folder (but it does not mean that the attacker can reach outside of the document root like `include`) while
path traversal attacking _outside_ the document root like logs and it not running a malicious code (like `reading dump file`). I hope you can understand what i mean ^^. Back to the topic.

i try using this code `../../../../../flag.txt` to searching flag inside and the result like this:
<img width="1054" height="183" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f727a99-1b0b-4cb8-bf32-9c0f2c9b3661" />

This has to be `Local file vulnerability` but remember, the code i use `../../../../../flag.txt` and not encode to base64 (if you ask `Is it possible to vulnerability using base64 encode?` the answer is yes! since the vulnerability using base64 and injection command using
`../../../flag.txt` which the result of decode base64 and the hidden file can be open). So lets goo to encode it.

Encode: `Li4vLi4vLi4vLi4vLi4vZmxhZy50eHQ=`

Here the result:

<img width="1470" height="737" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 100324" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8c5f11-e02a-4a4c-8223-1589f315d4e8" />

Note, you can use website only and using cyberchef to try inject without using `burp`.
