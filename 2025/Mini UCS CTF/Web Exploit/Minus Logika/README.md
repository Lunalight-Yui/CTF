So here we go to see this website

This is the template of website. There are register, username, password, and login. I don't think that this is `SQL Injection` besides there is `register` to enroll ourself to website. I'm using this:
Username: b
password: Adfghj1# (because need 1 Capital, small words, number, and symbol)

This is the template when the register has been successfully. Lets login to website

Just default template. there are ak-47, deagle, and flag. I interest with section `flag` and i open the burp with the website to be my target. Login and see something interest using burp.
I turn on intercept and buy flag. I changing parameter `price` from 99999 to 0 or 1 and here the result.

So i though something. it couldn't change the parameter price of flag. And my idea cames up. There is money

And then i try buy ak-46, then change the parameter of price. How i change it? by giving `-` like this to test it out first: 

<img width="360" height="79" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ba86515-66d8-4bdd-b51b-bd2d42f53208" />

And send it. It change my money from `2000` to `3600`! So Here the concept. This is **Parameter tampering/Business Logic Vulnerability** What's that??

Parameter tampering is a vulnerability that changing parameter. It manipulate the parameter to break the logical that we makes. For example like if you want to buy something like ak-47, Your money would be `400` right?
But this is different. We put `-` in front of `1600` it will be increase our money. The logic that been use like this. `Result = money_user - price`. Because we change the parameter price, it would be like this: `Result = money_user - (-price)`. 

This is one of the Parameter tampering vulnerability that you can found in here. There are many parameter tampering you can use like changing the password from `a` to `b`, etc. Back to the topic.

Here the result:

As you can see, my money increase from `2000` to `3600` because using **Parameter tampering**. So i found the vulnerability and the system doesn't alert me to change it besides only flag secure changing parameter tampering and 2 other nope.
I have an idea, changing from `-1600` to `-999999` and it is success!

So we can buy flag manually, and the flag achieved
