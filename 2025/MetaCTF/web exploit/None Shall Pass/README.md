Seems there is balance in here. Well then, interesting

# 『Flag』

So i solve this one unintended ways (or intended way, idk) using burp suite. so how this is work? this one:

<img width="296" height="154" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb43e66e-e4ec-4a33-a985-4ed9da54b65c" />

After that, go to flag then on `quantity` change `1` to `-10`. Like this:

<img width="642" height="770" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f99e51f-5261-44d9-8378-b9702109ee27" />

The result like this:

<img width="1919" height="612" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/349a6950-a9cf-4bb2-85d4-521440b2274a" />

Then you can buy it and proceed it. hwhw.

<img width="747" height="131" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00cc42fe-34dd-4cf5-9c96-7743ff39e485" />

```
Flag: MetaCTF{JWT_N0n3_4lg_3xpl01t}
```

i wonder what if intended ways to solve this one. Is this intended or not? 🤔
