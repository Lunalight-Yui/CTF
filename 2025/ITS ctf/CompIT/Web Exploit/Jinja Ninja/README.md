Very interesting, so lets solve!

So this challenge is same as this one ([click me](https://github.com/Lunalight-Yui/CTF/tree/main/2025/HCS/Web%20Exploit/Jinja%20Ninja)). As you can see, this is SSTI (server side template injection)

Try this code first: `{{7*7}}`. 

<img width="1919" height="905" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3599554b-a2a2-466c-a0d3-ab018a893b74" />

As you can see, this injection execute `{{7*7}}` inside the curly bracket. This is why `{{ ... }}` will execute inside the curly bracket like `config`, `1+2`, etc. So how use this `{{ ... }}` to bypass this injection?

This is jinja where python was the main used for this template. there are `config`, `globals` command to execute it. So i use this command:
```
{{lipsum.__globals__.os.popen('ls -R').read()}}
```

i use this from my mentor ([Daffainfo](https://github.com/daffainfo/ctf-writeup/tree/main/2023/0ByteCTF%202023/Guestbook%20(Beta))) to solve this one. So lets give it try.

What is this mean? it mean `ls` is to show up list information about files and directories within the file system. But what the other? i will explain when i list all of web exploit myself.

Next how to get some a flag list? remember `ls` can see on this too `ls /` so here the result

Owo, we got the flag! So use this one `cat /flag.txt`

```
Flag: compit{j1nj4_1nj3ct10n_15_d4ng3r0u5_4nd_fun}
