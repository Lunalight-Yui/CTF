Solve:

We're given link to get this website. Here's the template:

<img width="847" height="310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fb9c53c-ea99-45c8-8dab-50e57d84166f" />

There is a command line name `preg_replace`. What is that mean. If we use like this `../../../../flag.txt`, the `preg_replace` replace that to be `" "` (empty)

So how to faced this? Simple (and i forgot use this). By giving this:

`....//....//....//flflag.txtag.txt`, it will replace `../../../flag.txt` and become `../../../flag.txt` (since we double ../ and write `flag.txt` like this: `flflag.txtag.txt`

So here the result

<img width="1178" height="179" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ecaea85-7c3b-4273-990a-d7be8e6868cd" />

```

```
