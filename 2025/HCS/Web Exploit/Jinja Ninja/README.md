We're given a link to see the website. Here's the website template:

If i input `a`, here the result

But if input `{{7*7}}`, this is the result

If you know of this command `{{7*7}}`, we are faced of SSTI. So the command i use is `{{ lipsum.__globals__.os.popen('ls -R').read()}}`

I use this command from this repo reference: `https://github.com/daffainfo/ctf-writeup/tree/main/2023/0ByteCTF%202023/Guestbook%20(Beta)`. So here is the result

After that, i though it would be easy just `'cat flag.txt'`. But it didn't show up. And then, there is a clue from sentence that we can find using `/flag`. So i give it a try

Here the result:
